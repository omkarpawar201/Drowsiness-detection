# Drowsiness Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect drowsiness in real-time using eye features. The system uses computer vision techniques to monitor the user's eyes and play an alarm if drowsiness is detected based on a predefined threshold score.

## Features

- Real-time video stream processing
- Eye feature extraction and analysis
- Drowsiness detection using a scoring system
- Alarm activation when drowsiness is detected

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV
- dlib
- imutils
- scipy
- shutil

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
